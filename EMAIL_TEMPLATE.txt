Hi [Friend's Name],

I need help setting up DNS for [YOUR_DOMAIN.com] on GoDaddy to connect it to my website.

Here's what I need:

1. Log into GoDaddy.com
2. Go to "My Products" → "Domains" → [YOUR_DOMAIN.com] → "DNS" or "Manage DNS"
3. Remove any existing A records for "@" and "www" (if they exist)
4. Add these two new DNS records:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
RECORD 1: A Record (Root Domain)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Type: A
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Value: [VERCEL_IP_ADDRESS] (I'll send this after deployment)
TTL: 600 (or default)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
RECORD 2: CNAME Record (WWW)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [VERCEL_CNAME] (I'll send this after deployment)
TTL: 600 (or default)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After you add these records:
- It may take 24-48 hours to fully work (DNS propagation)
- Usually works within 1-2 hours
- I'll verify once it's set up

I'll send you the exact IP address and CNAME value after I deploy the site (should be in the next hour).

Thanks so much for your help!

[Your Name]
